<h1>Lottery Result Instant Refresh Script</h1>

<p>
  This project provides a simple and effective JavaScript-based solution to fix the browser caching problem often experienced on lottery result websites. Many lottery sites struggle with showing updated results instantly due to aggressive browser caching. This script ensures users always see the latest results without needing to refresh the page manually or clear browser cache.
</p>

<h2>🎯 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>✔️ Prevents browser from displaying outdated cached results</li>
  <li>✔️ Forces real-time result updates with minimal code</li>
  <li>✔️ Lightweight and easy to integrate into any HTML page</li>
  <li>✔️ Works with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)</li>
  <li>✔️ One-time setup — set and forget!</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ How It Works</h2>
<p>
  The main issue with lottery websites is that browsers cache the result pages or static content like images, causing users to see old results. This script adds a dynamic timestamp or cache-busting query parameter to your result-fetching URLs, which forces the browser to always fetch the latest version of the content.

<h2>📦 Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Download or clone this repository</li>
  <li>Include the JavaScript snippet in your HTML file</li>
  <li>Replace the <code>src</code> with your actual result file or content endpoint</li>
</ol>

<h2>💡 Why This Is Important</h2>
<p>
  Lottery users expect instant updates — even a few seconds of delay can result in confusion or misinformation. This script helps eliminate that risk by ensuring that users are always served the freshest content.
